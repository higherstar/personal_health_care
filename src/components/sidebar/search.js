      + 'Real-World Data (RWD) is defined as data relating to patient health routinely collected from a variety of '
      + 'sources outside of traditional controlled clinical interventional trials, under real-life clinical practice. '
      + 'The evidence derived from the analysis and/or synthesis of RWD is called Real-World Evidence (RWE).'
      + ' RWD can be collected from various sources such as electronic/medical health records, Digital Health '
      + 'solutions, pharmacy claims, insurance claims, disease and product registries, diagnostics/omics'
      + ' databases, hospitals/outpatient visits, health surveys and patient-reported outcomes (PROs),'
      + ' non-investigational studies, social media, etc.'
      + 'Why it is important for PHC '
      + 'Bridge evidence gaps of randomized control trials (RCTs)- The discovery of smaller and smaller '
      + 'patient sub-populations (e.g., rare cancer-driving genomic alterations) is making it unfeasible '
      + 'to run RCTs. Supplementary data sources, such as RWD, are needed to understand patient characteristics and'
      + ' treatment effectiveness. The heterogeneity of patient populations means that RCT data have low '
      + 'generalizability. This also leads to evidence gaps in treatments and patient outcomes in the real-world '
      + 'setting. However, RWD provides a much larger and more heterogeneous patient pool. RCTs are costly '
      + 'and time-consuming as compared to RWD.'
      + ' Smarter & more efficient R&D – Insights from RWD can provide learnings, '
      + 'such as treatment decisions in the real-world setting and molecularly-guided '
      + 'treatment options (MGTO). This can potentially fuel new research questions '
      + 'that can lead to smarter and more efficient R&D. '
      + 'RWD is a key component of our PHC vision and strategy because: '
      + 'RWD is a source of Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS). MDAS combines high quality, high volume of data per '
      + 'patient with the number of patients covered. In other words, MDAS is comprised of deep, longitudinal '
      + 'data from broad patient populations. '
      + "RWD fuels the PHC engine with continuous learning from every patient's "
      + 'experience to create both a high-resolution view of each patient and treatments '
      + "personalized to each patient's needs. "
      + 'Downstream use of RWE in regulatory / Health Technology Assessment (HTA) / payer '
      + 'decision-making can also facilitate and support the approvals of novel PHC solutions. '
      + 'What Roche is doing in this area '
      + 'Roche’s RWD assets span sources including platforms, registries, and genomic databases. Roche is using RWD to '
      + 'advance Research, Regulatory, Access, Medical and Commercial objectives. '
      + 'Key considerations of using RWD '
      + 'Harmonizing data from multiple sources while retaining data comprehensiveness '
      + 'Ensuring similar data quality and compatibility '
      + 'Extracting meaningful information from unstructured data (e.g., physician notes or genomic testing reports) '
      + 'Validating RWD endpoints '
      + 'Identifying and accounting for biases '
      + 'Guaranteeing consent, patient privacy and confidentiality '
      + 'Securing needed resources for planning, educating, collecting / upkeeping data, quality control, etc. '
      + 'Taking into consideration the lack of sources of high-quality RWD in ex-US markets '
      + 'Taking into consideration that the market for structured / curated data is nascent '
      + 'Taking into consideration the possibility of immature consensus of defining regulatory-grade '

      + '\n'
      + '“Rozlytrek represents everything that we stand for when it comes to personalised healthcare (PHC). In fact it\'s a medicine that is impossible without PHC! Here’s why:\n'
      + 'In the past we worked to treat a specific tumor type, for example lung cancer or breast cancer, and where possible added a companion diagnostic. With Rozlytrek we have a medicine that is tumor agnostic, meaning we focus on a cancer’s genomic alterations rather than in which organ the cancer started in the body. In the case of Rozlytrek we are targeting tumors with mutations in ROS1 or NTRK genes.\n'
      + 'Because these rare mutations occur in numerous tumor types, molecular profiling and next-generation sequencing play an essential role in identifying individuals who can benefit, and this has implications for how we work with healthcare systems to bring this medicine to market. Unless we establish molecular profiling as part of the standard of care, many patients will never have the chance to benefit from Rozlytrek. And having seen remarkable response rates, particularly in patients whose cancer has spread to the brain, we are compelled to see this through.\n'
      + 'PHC, in the form of real-world data, was also essential to the Rozlytrek clinical development approach. In one of our studies it was not feasible to include a comparator arm due to the rarity of the patient group we were studying — so we developed an external control arm using Flatiron data to compare the Rozlytrek treated patients against a real-world cohort treated with the standard of care. This comparative real-word data have been submitted to authorities with our filings in the US, Japan and Europe and are a great example of making research more efficient and providing a better option for participants; since all received Rozlytrek, none received placebo."\n'
