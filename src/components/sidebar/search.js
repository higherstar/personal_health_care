      + 'Real-World Data (RWD) is defined as data relating to patient health routinely collected from a variety of '
      + 'sources outside of traditional controlled clinical interventional trials, under real-life clinical practice. '
      + 'The evidence derived from the analysis and/or synthesis of RWD is called Real-World Evidence (RWE).'
      + ' RWD can be collected from various sources such as electronic/medical health records, Digital Health '
      + 'solutions, pharmacy claims, insurance claims, disease and product registries, diagnostics/omics'
      + ' databases, hospitals/outpatient visits, health surveys and patient-reported outcomes (PROs),'
      + ' non-investigational studies, social media, etc.'
      + 'Why it is important for PHC '
      + 'Bridge evidence gaps of randomized control trials (RCTs)- The discovery of smaller and smaller '
      + 'patient sub-populations (e.g., rare cancer-driving genomic alterations) is making it unfeasible '
      + 'to run RCTs. Supplementary data sources, such as RWD, are needed to understand patient characteristics and'
      + ' treatment effectiveness. The heterogeneity of patient populations means that RCT data have low '
      + 'generalizability. This also leads to evidence gaps in treatments and patient outcomes in the real-world '
      + 'setting. However, RWD provides a much larger and more heterogeneous patient pool. RCTs are costly '
      + 'and time-consuming as compared to RWD.'
      + ' Smarter & more efficient R&D – Insights from RWD can provide learnings, '
      + 'such as treatment decisions in the real-world setting and molecularly-guided '
      + 'treatment options (MGTO). This can potentially fuel new research questions '
      + 'that can lead to smarter and more efficient R&D. '
      + 'RWD is a key component of our PHC vision and strategy because: '
      + 'RWD is a source of Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS). MDAS combines high quality, high volume of data per '
      + 'patient with the number of patients covered. In other words, MDAS is comprised of deep, longitudinal '
      + 'data from broad patient populations. '
      + "RWD fuels the PHC engine with continuous learning from every patient's "
      + 'experience to create both a high-resolution view of each patient and treatments '
      + "personalized to each patient's needs. "
      + 'Downstream use of RWE in regulatory / Health Technology Assessment (HTA) / payer '
      + 'decision-making can also facilitate and support the approvals of novel PHC solutions. '
      + 'What Roche is doing in this area '
      + 'Roche’s RWD assets span sources including platforms, registries, and genomic databases. Roche is using RWD to '
      + 'advance Research, Regulatory, Access, Medical and Commercial objectives. '
      + 'Key considerations of using RWD '
      + 'Harmonizing data from multiple sources while retaining data comprehensiveness '
      + 'Ensuring similar data quality and compatibility '
      + 'Extracting meaningful information from unstructured data (e.g., physician notes or genomic testing reports) '
      + 'Validating RWD endpoints '
      + 'Identifying and accounting for biases '
      + 'Guaranteeing consent, patient privacy and confidentiality '
      + 'Securing needed resources for planning, educating, collecting / upkeeping data, quality control, etc. '
      + 'Taking into consideration the lack of sources of high-quality RWD in ex-US markets '
      + 'Taking into consideration that the market for structured / curated data is nascent '
      + 'Taking into consideration the possibility of immature consensus of defining regulatory-grade '
      + 'RWD and levels of quality that are fit-for-purpose',
