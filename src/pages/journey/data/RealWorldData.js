    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Real-World Data (RWD)</strong>
      {' '}
is defined as data relating to patient health routinely
      collected from a variety of sources outside of traditional controlled clinical interventional
      trials, under real-life clinical practice.
    </p>
    <p>
The evidence derived from the analysis and/or synthesis of RWD is
      called
      <strong>Real-World Evidence (RWE)</strong>
.
    </p>
    <p>
RWD can be collected from various sources such as electronic/medical health records,
      Digital Health solutions, pharmacy claims, insurance claims, disease and product registries,
      diagnostics/omics databases, hospitals/outpatient visits, health surveys and patient-reported
      outcomes (PROs), non-investigational studies, social media, etc.
    </p>
    <h2>
Why it is important for PHC
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Bridge evidence gaps of randomized control trials (RCTs)- </strong>
The discovery of smaller
      and smaller patient sub-populations (e.g., rare cancer-driving genomic alterations) is making
      it unfeasible to run RCTs. Supplementary data sources, such as RWD, are needed to understand
      patient characteristics and treatment effectiveness. The heterogeneity of patient populations
      means that RCT data have low generalizability. This also leads to evidence gaps in treatments
      and patient outcomes in the real-world setting. However, RWD provides a much larger and more
      heterogeneous patient pool. RCTs are costly and time-consuming as compared to RWD.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Smarter & more efficient R&D – </strong>
Insights from RWD can provide learnings,
      such as treatment decisions in the real-world setting and molecularly-guided treatment
      options (MGTO). This can potentially fuel new research questions that can lead to smarter
      and more efficient R&D.

    <span>
RWD is a key component of our PHC vision and strategy because:
      <li>
                  RWD is a source of Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS). MDAS combines high quality, high volume
                  of data per patient with the number of patients covered. In other words, MDAS is comprised
                  of
        {' '}
        <strong>deep, longitudinal data from broad patient populations</strong>
.
      </li>
      <li>
                  RWD fuels the PHC engine with continuous learning from every patient
        {'\''}
s experience to create both a
                  high-resolution view of each patient and treatments personalized to each patient
        {'\''}
s needs.
      </li>
      <li>
                  Downstream use of RWE in regulatory / Health Technology Assessment (HTA) / payer
                  decision-making can also
        {' '}
        <strong>facilitate and support the approvals of novel PHC solutions</strong>
.

Roche’s RWD assets span sources including platforms,
          registries, and genomic databases.

Key considerations of using RWD
    </h2>
    <li>
Harmonizing data from multiple sources while retaining data comprehensiveness
    </li>
    <li>
                      Ensuring similar data quality and compatibility
    </li>
    <li>
                      Extracting meaningful information from unstructured data
                      (e.g., physician notes or genomic testing reports)
    </li>
    <li>
Validating RWD endpoints
    </li>
    <li>
                      Identifying and accounting for biases
    </li>
    <li>
                      Guaranteeing consent, patient privacy and confidentiality
    </li>
    <li>
                      Securing needed resources for planning, educating, collecting / upkeeping data, quality control,
                      etc.
    </li>
    <li>
                      Taking into consideration the lack of sources of high-quality RWD in ex-US markets
    </li>
    <li>
                      Taking into consideration that the market for structured / curated data is nascent
    </li>
    <li>
                      Taking into consideration the possibility of immature consensus of defining regulatory-grade
                      RWD and levels of quality that are fit-for-purpose
