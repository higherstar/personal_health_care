    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced imaging refers to the use of computer algorithms to analyze digital outputs of X-rays,
      computed tomography
      (CT), ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) that are used
      for medical diagnosis.

      Why it is important & connection to our PHC vision and strategy (see PHC vision & strategy diagram on
      the left)
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Smarter & more efficient R&D - </strong>
      By automating time-consuming & costly processes
      (e.g., secondary imaging reads & IRFs), this effort will result in significantly faster trials,
      while more accurate quantification of disease burden will enable robust cohort matching for use in
      synthetic control arm studies.
      <sup>2</sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved access & personalized care - </strong>
      Development of automated algorithms can provide
      better and more accurate measurements of disease than currently available to help predict progression
      and response to therapy.
      <sup>2</sup>
      <br />
      These could deliver significant savings to health systems, or allow emerging health
      systems to deliver advanced care with a lower investment in infrastructure and other system resources.

      The multi-functional PHC IX Imaging team is developing and implementing a Global Imaging Platform
      with tools for scientists and others to store, curate and analyze imaging data. The team is currently
      leading a pilot program to deploy and drive adoption within Roche of a production-ready system.

    <h2>Key drivers/considerations</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Sharing/Privacy - </strong>
      When sharing images externally with 3rd parties
      (and even internally), there is a need to take data privacy into consideration. It matters to
      consider privacy, security, transparency, and patients control to opt out of any aspect at any
      time. The
      {' '}
      <Link to="/phc/systems-enablers/partner/policy">Data Privacy team</Link>
      {' '}
      can help determine the
      right level of privacy required before data can be shared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data policy development â€“ </strong>
      Regulation and guidance are needed to ensure
      collection of
      {' '}
      <Link to="/phc/future-patient-journey/data/real-world-data">high-quality data and interoperability</Link>
      {' '}
      of
      systems to facilitate sharing, all the while protecting patient privacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Contracts - </strong>
      When entering into partnerships with commercial companies and academic
      institutions, be aware of complex intellectual property(IP) negotiations. Important to have both
      Legal and Partnering take a proactive lead to put a contract in place that meets the needs
      of the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Complex data - </strong>
      The scale of the imaging data requires close collaboration and
      coordination with The multi-functional
