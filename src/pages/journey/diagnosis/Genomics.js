      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        Genomic profiling is a broad term that refers to the sequencing and analysis of genomic alterations
        (base substitutions, insertions and deletions, copy number alterations, and rearrangements) and
        biomarkers that are known to be relevant in a disease.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the molecular level, the expression of certain genes is used as biomarker to determine the
        appropriate therapy for cancer patients. Biomarkers are thus a key component of Personalized
        Healthcare approaches. Appropriate biomarkers are also essential to design clinical studies and
        to define their intended or expected outcome. Diagnostic methods such as Next-Generation Sequencing
        (NGS) and Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) aim at identifying and quantifying disease-relevant
        biomarkers.
        <br />
        <br />
        At Roche, we are developing our genomic diagnostics capability, including biomarkers, Next-Generation
        Sequencing (NGS) and Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) to further enable personalized
        healthcare (PHC).
        <br />
        <br />
        Roche Sequencing Solutions offers best in-class Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) products.
        Clinical NGS can involve one single gene to many genes and provides clinicians with information
        to assist in treatment selection [internal hyperlink to CDS in Care], thus enabling personalized
        healthcare (PHC). Advanced reports, such as those FMI deliver, provide information including
        clinical trials, treatments to avoid and potential resistance gene of relevance.
        <br />
        <br />
        Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP) is a type of genomic profiling that involves large gene
        panels that detect all classes of genomic alterations and biomarkers, providing a holistic view to
        healthcare providers of appropriate treatments [internal hyperlink to CDS page in Care]
        (targeted or immunotherapy) and potential clinical trials.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Why it is important for PHC
      </h2>
      <p>
        Roche is leveraging NGS/CGP in several ways to promote PHC.

        <strong>
          Improved access & personalized care
        </strong>
        Foundation Medicine (FMI) is leading the understanding and use of CGP in the clinical setting,

        and laying the
        foundation for pan-tumor targeted therapy, which
        cannot be delivered with current technology.
        <br />
        Advanced comprehensive clinical-genomic databases can inform treatment decisions through clinical
        decision (CDS) systems [link to CDS page under Care] using the power

        What Roche is doing in this area
      </h2>
      <p>
        Roche is expanding its “Omics and Biomarkers” capabilities. Moreover, the Omics Team
        collaborate closely

        {' '}

        The CUPISCO trial is an example of the use of CGP in combination with a patient-centric
        decision-making process by a Molecular Tumor Board to provide a highly-specific treatment
