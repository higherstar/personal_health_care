    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
Increased volumes of healthcare data are now available to both HCPs and patients. This
      overwhelming growth in healthcare data is making clinical decisions more complex. High-quality Clinical
      Decision Support (CDS) leverages objective health data and analytics to improve individual patient
      outcomes by enabling more confident clinical decisions in real time at the point of care. Most CDS
      solution are currently in Oncology, followed by Neuroscience and Ophthalmologyâ€”all areas of interest
      for Roche.

Why it is important for PHC
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Improved access & personalized care</strong>
      <br />
CDS systems have the potential to improve
            both healthcare provider and patient experiences as well as to enable a shared decision
            making between HCPs and their patients. High quality CDS systems should also act as Patient
            Decision Support by providing relevant information and including a patient interface.

    <p>
CDS systems will also impact pharmaceutical industries by influencing how products
                are represented at the time of clinical decision making.

At Roche Pharma, our vision is that high-quality CDS systems improve individual patient

      <br />
                      1. CDS systems are of high quality.
      <br />
                      2. We are prepared to operate in an environment where CDS has significant influence on clinical
                      care.
      <br />
                      However, in order to maintain our objectivity and credibility, Roche Pharma is not independently
                      developing or commercializing CDS systems.
