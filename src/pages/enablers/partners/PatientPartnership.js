    <h2>
Patient Partnership in PHC
    </h2>
    <p>
PHC is important because of its potential to improve the health and wellbeing of people
          living with different conditions. Key benefits for patients include better prediction of
          those who are at risk of disease, earlier diagnosis, more targeted treatment and care,
          earlier detection and management of side effects, improved quality of life and enhanced
          health and wellbeing.
    </p>
    <p>
          Despite advances that have been made to date, much work is needed to ensure that patients have access
          to the potentially transformative benefits of PHC, Patient communities have an important role to play
          in advancing the PHC agenda.

                      can achieve differing goals along the value chain.
