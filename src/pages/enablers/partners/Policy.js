    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
Legal frameworks around the collection, processing & sharing of data is an important enabler
      for PHC. Stakeholders such as patients, healthcare providers (HCPs), regulators and policy
      makers, may be involved.
    </p>
    <h2>
Why it is important in PHC
    </h2>
    <span>
It is important to identify, understand and address key barriers to building and gaining access to
                Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS). Initial barriers to considered are:
      <li>Cost</li>
      <li>Scale (breadth and depth)</li>
      <li>Infrastructure</li>
      <li>Lack of incentives to share data</li>
      <li>Data quality and completeness; unstructured nature of data</li>
      <li>Access mode and timeliness of access</li>
      <li>Data privacy laws and regulations</li>
      <li>Patient & health system cultural perspectives and attitudes</li>
      <li>Intellectual property</li>
      <li>Variation in data governance</li>
      <li>Transparency</li>

    <h2>What Roche is doing in this area</h2>
    <span>
From a data policy perspective as an organization both at the affiliate and global levels we want
      to work to establish data ecosystems focusing on data privacy, sharing,
      quality and interoperability. These policy areas will enable collection,
      aggregation, curation, and analysis of patient-level data from different
      sources, including
      {' '}
      <Link to="/phc/future-patient-journey/data/real-world-data">
      electronic health records (EHR)
      </Link>
, advanced
      {' '}
      <Link to="/phc/future-patient-journey/diagnosis/diagnostics">diagnostics</Link>
      {' '}
platforms,
      and
      {' '}
      <Link to="/phc/future-patient-journey/diagnosis/digital-health">digital tools</Link>
. This generates
      insights into health, disease, and treatment pathways at the population and patient level,
      ultimately enabling the delivery of PHC.
    </span>
    <span>
      From a regulatory and access policy perspective, this data can also be used to guide decisions by:
      <li>Providing disease context</li>
      <li>Justifying unmet medical need</li>
      <li>Demonstrating safety and effectiveness in new populations</li>
      <li>Serving as an external control arm</li>
    </span>
    <br />
    <h2>Key drivers/considerations</h2>
    <p>
Data Privacy is a key area where adoption of legislation is emerging and requirements vary across
        geographies. Some of this emerging legislation is due to actions from other industries with little
        consideration for the impact on health data specifically.
    </p>
    <p>
        How
      {' '}
      <strong>Roche</strong>
      {' '}
and those we share data with collect, manage and analyze data including
        de-identification,
        anonymization should be transparent to reinforce our commitment to data privacy. Roche needs access
        to high-quality, interoperable data to realize PHC. Policy that enables access to and sharing of
        data is key, as well as policy that supports implementation of data quality and interoperability
        standards.
