      "Value-Based HealthCare (VBHC) is proposed as a sustainable model, shifting the incentive away from treatment volume towards value for patients, providers and healthcare systems. VBHC focuses on the outcomes that matter to patients." +
      "Why it is important " +
      "VBHC aligns with Roche’s core focus on what patients need. This model would ensure that outcomes that matter to patients are prioritized. In this way, we will be a real healthcare partner and deliver value to our patients beyond just treatment and medication, from timely diagnoses to tangible, long-term health results." +
      " VBHC will present new healthcare service partnership opportunities to Roche, allowing us to expand and improve our offerings. Incorporating VBHC into our ways of working is an innovative step that will differentiate ourselves." +
      " Why it is important (Cont.)" +
      " Emerging technologies are now making the implementation of VBHC possible on a wider scale. Most importantly, Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS) will allow Roche to use analytics to inform our healthcare offerings. We can use data in predictive models to anticipate the outcomes associated with different care cycles, reducing the level of risk for patients, healthcare systems, and payers." +
      " Connection to our PHC vision and strategy (see PHC vision & strategy diagram on the left)" +
      " Value-Based HealthCare is an important transition in healthcare where we can realize our PHC vision. By partnering and co-creating with our internal and external stakeholders, we can contribute to building sustainable healthcare systems." +
      " Roche approach to VBHC Roche contributes to change healthcare systems." +
      " Key drivers/considerations " +
      "IT platform, Meaningful Data at Scale (MDAS), and policy all play a key role in enabling our success for implementing Value-Based HealthCare. " +
      "We require a robust IT infrastructure that enables patient data to be shared optimally, across borders and services. " +
      "Our IT platform must be able to collect MDAS to inform our analyses and algorithms. A rigorous approach to data analysis is essential to implementing VBHC. " +
      "Well-designed, clear policies are another crucial component of rolling out our VBHC. We need to minimize regulatory hurdles and ensure that we are able to analyze patients and segment data effectively and responsibly."

      "Quote from Head of Roche Pharma, Bill Anderson, on Rozlytrek: " +
      "“Rozlytrek represents everything that we stand for when it comes to personalised healthcare (PHC). In fact it's a medicine that is impossible without PHC! Here’s why: " +
      "In the past we worked to treat a specific tumor type, for example lung cancer or breast cancer, and where possible added a companion diagnostic. With Rozlytrek we have a medicine that is tumor agnostic, meaning we focus on a cancer’s genomic alterations rather than in which organ the cancer started in the body. In the case of Rozlytrek we are targeting tumors with mutations in ROS1 or NTRK genes. " +
      "Because these rare mutations occur in numerous tumor types, molecular profiling and next-generation sequencing play an essential role in identifying individuals who can benefit, and this has implications for how we work with healthcare systems to bring this medicine to market. Unless we establish molecular profiling as part of the standard of care, many patients will never have the chance to benefit from Rozlytrek. And having seen remarkable response rates, particularly in patients whose cancer has spread to the brain, we are compelled to see this through. " +
      "PHC, in the form of real-world data, was also essential to the Rozlytrek clinical development approach. In one of our studies it was not feasible to include a comparator arm due to the rarity of the patient group we were studying — so we developed an external control arm using Flatiron data to compare the Rozlytrek treated patients against a real-world cohort treated with the standard of care. This comparative real-word data have been submitted to authorities with our filings in the US, Japan and Europe and are a great example of making research more efficient and providing a better option for participants; since all received Rozlytrek, none received placebo. " +
